The balancedteams R package uses a 
[mixed integer linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming)
algorithm [@ompr] that takes a player or group (for players that baggage 
together) score and assigns the “best” group to the worst performing team, 
starting with some random initialization of the teams. There are a number of 
ways to come up with this score but common methods used by our collaborators 
include an average of a self-survey and/or a captain’s assessment of a 
player’s athleticism.

## Installation

You can install the development version of balancedteams 
from [github](https://github.com/apeterson91/balancedteams) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("apeterson91/balancedteams)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you generate teams.

```{r libraries}
library(balancedteams)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r aux_functions, echo = FALSE}
GetMeanScore <- function(df) {
  out <- dplyr::group_by(df, team_id) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(`Mean Score` = mean(score),
                   `Median Score` = median(score),
            `# Groups` = dplyr::n()) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(team_id)
  
  return(out)
}
```

```{r view_data}
head(mens_team)
```

```{r algorithm}
team_config_one <- GenerateBalancedTeams(mens_team$group_id, 
                                         mens_team$group_score,
                                         num_teams = 7)
GetMeanScore(team_config_one)
```
